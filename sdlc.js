// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

// NOTE: I used the option key with up/down arrows for reorganize :)



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is where you determine what you need to make it work, such as the languages to be used, what software is needed, services, who is involved in the project and what their roles/responsibilites are."
const design = "Determine what the software will look look visually, how it will function (front and back end), and how it will be organized/what folders will be used/how it will be stored."
const implementation = "This is the building process. Involves the coding and the setting up of infrastructure for the system."
const testingAndIntegration = "QA members will view and use the system as users would, testing code to ensure it works in every scenerio, fixing bugs/problems before it goes live to the public. Integration is getting the software online ready for use: deploying the software to the public. "
const maintain = "Maintenance is is continual repeating of these steps as needed, allowing for changes and scaling to occur while the software is being used."
